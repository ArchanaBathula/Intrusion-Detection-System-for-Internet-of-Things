A well-performing machine learning algorithm called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is developed with improved network architecture. The usage of a renowned meta-heuristic algorithm called Spotted Hyena Optimization (SHO) is used for selecting the optimal hidden neurons for ANN. The main objective of the improved training is to minimize the error difference between the target and the measured output, so as to enhance the detection accuracy. Finally, the experimental results and simulations prove the stability and robustness of the proposed model in terms of a variety of performance metrics over other machine learning models.
